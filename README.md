## About Us

8-bit Arcade is an emerging web2.5 gaming platform designed for independent games. Because they work on desktops as well as mobile devices, WebGL and HTML5 based games are the primary area of our interest. Our goal is to create a framework that enables traditional gamers to easily transition to blockchain gaming with just one click, thereby bridging the gap between web2 and web3 gaming.

We at 8-Bit Arcade are convinced that by promoting a cooperative environment for game developers and players, we will emerge as the go-to source for the most popular games worldwide. Our platform will serve a broad spectrum of gamers by providing a varied assortment of independent, classic, and contemporary interactive games. We'll work together to deliver the best possible gaming experience.

This platform is designed to offer a seamless experience for onboarding traditional gamers. Users get to sign up by providing basic details like their email address and password. Every user is given a distinct Decentralized Identity (DID) upon registration (which could be a mix of their Ethereum address and a platform-generated identification). Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) serve as distinct identifiers on blockchain networks. A more individualized and simple way to represent your SBTs is using custom DiD domain names.

Soulbound tokens (SBTs) are one of the main components of the registration procedure. These tokens are not intended for sale or transfer, and they will always be linked to your wallet address.The 8-Bit Arcade account of the user is essentially connected to these tokens since they are minted and linked to their 8Bit Account, their Ethereum address and to their Substrate address (this aspect still required development). The Ethereum blockchain integration guarantees a transparent and safe user experience.

Users are encouraged to connect their cryptocurrency wallets or they will be auto-assigned one on first login to their 8Bit Arcade accounts in order to improve security and ownership verification. Once connected, the Soulbound token contract makes it easier to communicate with these cryptocurrency wallets( web3auth in this case, a multichain wallet), enabling users to utilize their linked wallets to confirm ownership.

Going one step further, the platform lets users use their linked wallets and Soulbound tokens to communicate with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) contracts and hopefully substrate ones too. Through this interaction, users can communicate with EVM contracts, carry out specific tasks, and access different services inside the decentralized ecosystem as well as communicate with substrates via XCM.

To provide a more complete identification solution, 8Bit Arcade connects its user authorization and identity verification processes with third-party APIs. Users can expedite the verification process and improve the general protection of their identities by granting the application permission to access identity-related data through these APIs.

The application understands how important it is to enable users to enhance their decentralized identity by requesting proofs and attestations from third-party services. Users now have an adaptable and safe method to handle their identity-related data thanks to the ability to keep these proofs either off-chain or on-chain.

Moonbeam was the main platform that was used to build this application. Moonbeam is an Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform on Polkadot that works with ERC-20 assets. Developers may easily transfer their Ethereum apps to Polkadot with the help of this protocol, requiring minimal additional work.

To summarize, the process of using 8Bit Arcade involves creating Decentralized Identities (DIDs) for new users, issuing Soulbound tokens that are connected to their Ethereum addresses, and integrating with cryptocurrency wallets to improve privacy and ownership verification.

In the future 8Bit Arcade will be developing a blockchain architectural solution that will enable a seamless user experience on one platform. The DiD will play a big part in helping overcome some of the obstacles that are currently experienced by gamers in the web3 space.
